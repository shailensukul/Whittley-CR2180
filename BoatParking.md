# Boat Parking

I have a wide driveway, and got the CR2180 model because I could park it on one side of the driveway and still be able to move cars and park them without 
too much of a hassle. 

In order to do that, I needed a way to unhitch my boat trailer, park my car and manouver the trailer/boat, until it was really close to the side fence.

I started my research into a boat mover or motorized Jockey wheel, but information on this is really hard to come by.

Now, if you are a professional boat company, sure you can go ahead and get a > $3000 mover but that was too expensive for me.

My biggest difficulty was that the smaller, cheaper movers all come with a disclaimer: `Not for dual axel trailers`.

I narrowed down my selections to 2 kinds of electric Jockey wheels:
* A 350 watt model
* A 550 watt model

Based on the weight of my boat, I settled on the 550 watt model.

I only have a 3 degree incline on an aggregate driveway, and so I was confident that it would work.



I bought this model  online and drove to pick it up from Braeside:

They also ship it, but I could not wait, as we had taken delivery of the boat.

I had an existing `90 AH Kayak deep cycle battery`, which I was planning to use with this, but any 12V battery should do, though I would recommend a deep cycle battery.

## Installing

Initially, I wanted to install the bracket myself.
But after breaking several drill bits, I decided to call in an expert. 


The trailer is Australian made and typically overengineered, which is not a bad thing.
The professionals turned up and also had a little difficulty at first, but managed to complete the job in an hour.

In the end, I had perfectly aligned holes to mount the Jockey wheel bracket.

(Note: The installer had to slightly trim the bottom left end, near the chain link to make it fit)

Make sure that the bracket it nice and tight, and then you can install the Jockey wheel.

When fitting the Jockey pole to the bracket, again **make sure that it is nice and tight**

Then connect the guiding handle to the pole.

I then raise my jockey wheel up but still leave the other wheel on to catch it if it slips (which it has due to not tightening enough).

## Moving

It will not turn on a dime due to the 4 wheels at the back of the trailer, so you'll have to make lots of 3 points turns.

However, with a little practice, I can comfortable park it close to the fence.
