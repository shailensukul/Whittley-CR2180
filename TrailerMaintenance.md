# Trailer Maintentenance

Our boat came with a 2021 Mackay dual axel trailer with progressive or intertia-based braking.
We have it hitched to a Toyota Lancruiser Prado.  

Initially, I was concerned about inertia-based breaking, as the feedback on breaking is slighlt delayed.
However, with these precautions, I am satisfied that towing can be safe:

* Be vigilant while driving and do not break suddenly
* Take wide turns around corners to avoid the trailer wheel hitting the curb
* When backing the trailer straight, look at your two side mirrors. 
The trailer's/boat's side should appear to be the same size when backing up. 
If the image in one mirror appears larger than the other mirror, then steer towards the larger image, until both images are the same size and straigten the wheel.

## Tips

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

* Purchase a spare tyre wrench and keep it in the boat. When travelling over long distances, 
the nuts will come loose due to vibratation and it is a good idea to stop every hour and check and tighten them.

* Purchase a scissor jack and keep in the boat. Most modern cars comes with a pneumatic jacks, which will collapse under the weight.

* Purchase a mobile tyre inflator. I got the Ozito PXC 18V 240V Hybrid Inflator, which works off 18V DC or 240V AC. 

If you are running low on tyre pressure and in the middle of nowhere, this device can come in very handy!

* Get wheel chocks to stop the trailer rolling off, when parked.

* Get a trailer lock as a safety precaution when parking your trailer in public places.
