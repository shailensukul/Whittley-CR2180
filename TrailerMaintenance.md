# Trailer Maintentenance

Our boat came with a 2021 Mackay dual axel trailer with progressive or intertia-based braking.
We have it hitched to a Toyota Lancruiser Prado.  

Initially, I was concerned about inertia-based breaking, since the feedback is slighltly delayed.
However, with some precautions, I am satisfied that towing can be safe:

* Be vigilant while driving and do not brake suddenly.

* Make wide turns around corners to avoid the trailer wheel hitting the curb.

* When backing the trailer straight, watch your two side mirrors. 
The trailer's/boat's reflected images should be the same size when backing up.<br/></br>
If the image in one mirror appears larger than the other mirror, then steer towards the larger image, until both images are the same size and straigten the wheel.

## Tips

* Always wash of the trailer with a good wash (I use Salt Away) and spray the brake calipers, springs and brake discs with Innox.

* At a minimum, annually check your bearings (change and or re-grease) and brake pads, and optionally, change the brake fluid also.
(You may want to look into Bearing Buddy, but I prefer not to)

* Purchase a spare tyre wrench and keep it in the boat. 

When travelling over long distances, the nuts will may loosen due to vibratation and it is a good idea to stop and check and tighten them, when you make your pit stops.

* Purchase a scissor jack and keep it in the boat. Most modern cars come with a pneumatic jacks, which will collapse under the weight.

* Purchase a mobile tyre inflator. I got the Ozito PXC 18V 240V Hybrid Inflator, which works off 18V DC or 240V AC.
Great for charging our regular tyres as well! 

If you are running low on tyre pressure and are in the middle of nowhere, this device can come in very handy!

* Get wheel chocks to stop the trailer rolling off, when parked.

* Get a towbar lock as a safety precaution when parking your trailer in public places.
