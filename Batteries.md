# Batteries

There are 2 batteries in the Whittley CR 2180:
- Starter battery
- House battery


There is a black switch, called the battery combiner, located near the battery on/off switches. 

If the starter battery is low on charge, the combiner will combine the charge from the starter and the house batteries.

The battery panel also contains the 2 circuit breakers, including a 60 amp one for the winch.

Be sure to turn the red switches to the off position when storing your boat.

## Battery charger
The battery charger will charge the house battery first. When it is full, it will switch over to charge the starter battery.

## Checking battery levels
The volt guage on the guage cluster shows the charge of the starter battery.

You can view the voltage of the house battery from the GPS/Fish finder unit.

You can also install a cheap battery monitor which can relay battery statistics to your phone over Bluetooth.
